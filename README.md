Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project that we worked on was a project that focused on turning a simple TI board into a thermostat that could give us indications towards the temprature of the room. 

What did you do particularly well?
During this project, There were many complications and unfortunately, was unable to submit a working project in. After weeks of working on the project, there was an issue
with UART transfering to UART2, and most of the material was over UART. Along with this, personal matters affected the overal quality of my work.
Where could you improve?
I could have greatly improved in setting more time to work on the project. the few weeks prior to the submission date, personal matters had started to arise and 
required much more attention than I was able to give. With this, it hurts to say that I was unable to finish..
